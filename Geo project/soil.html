			<h1>Soil!</h1>
			<p>The Pacific Maritime ecozone experiences a maritime climate, where the temperature is influenced by the ocean currents, making the temperature
			moderate along with lots of precipitation. Since the Pacific Maritime ecozone receives lots of precipitation, it is full of Podzolic soil.
			<br>Podzolic soil is forested soil found in ecozones that receives lots of precipitation(average precipitation is 700mm or above). Podzolic soil
			contains lots of humus, which is very important for plant growth and also contains lots minerals. Since the Pacific Maritime does receive lots of precipitation, the soil is also leached due to being
			over watered. When a soil is leached, it results in poor topsoil, but there are many minerals, humus and nutrients buried further down into the
			soil due the downward movement of the water carrying the minerals further down into the soil.</p>
