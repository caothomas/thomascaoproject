			<h1>Climate!</h1>
			<p>The Pacific Maritime is located on Canadaâ€™s Western Coastline mainly in British Columbia. The climate in this ecozone is quite wet and 
			receives lots of rainfall. This is because the Pacific Maritime is on the leeward side of the Rocky Mountains. Since the ecozone is located 
			near a large body of water, the climate is less extreme, with cooler summers and warmer winters than other areas in canada. <br>
			<br>
			Due to a large number of mountains located in this ecozone, the mountains block out most of the precipitation and the interior receives 
			far more precipitation per year than other areas. Some areas receive only around 600mm of precipitation per year while some areas can 
			receive up to 1500mm of precipitation per year. With all the precipitation that the ecozone receives, it supports many of the lush forests
			in the ecozone.
