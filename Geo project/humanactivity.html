			<h1>Human Activity!</h1>
			<p id="one">Human activity has greatly affected the Pacific Maritime ecozone. There are over 2.5 million people are living in the Pacific Maritime ecozone and 
			the population has increased greatly due to immigration. Rapid urbanization is also affecting the ecozone, making it hard to protect the 
			wildlife habitats and agricultural land. Industries are a major human activity and there are 3 main industries in the Pacific Maritime ecozone, forestry, farming, and fishing. </p>

			<P id="two">Forestry includes logging and other forestry related industries like paper.
			Logging is when trees are cut down and sold as timber or pulp and this has impacted the landscape greatly, but many people do depend on this industry for the jobs it provides.
			120 years ago over 2 million hectares of coastal rain forests were clear-cut. </p>

			<img id="fishing" src="../images/fishing.jpg" alt="Picture of fishing" width="400" height="200">
			<p id="three">The second industry fishing, is very important to coastal communities for they are near the Pacific ocean and supplied with lots of fish. 
			The Pacific Maritime not only includes that Pacific ocean, but inlets, rivers, and lakes as well where people can fish,
			but now some of these areas are now used for boat tours and transportation. 
			In these bodies of water include many different species of fish that can be found in the Pacific Maritime.</p>

			<img id="farming" src="../images/farming.jpg" alt="Picture of Farming" width="400" height="200">
			<p id="four">The third main industry is farming. Farming is also very popular since the Pacific Maritime contains Podzolic soil, which is soil that
			contains lots of humus and minerals that helps with plant growth. Not only does the Pacific Maritime contain Podzolic soil, but it also
			receives lots of precipitation and has 200-260 days for the growing season.</p>
